# This is my Manager README
I think we'll work for effectively together if you know a bit about me. So here goes!

## About Me
First off, you can call me Eric or EJ (to avoid a Planning & Tracking name collision w/ [@aricwalker](https://github.com/aricwalker).

- I am a self-taught engineer and management nerd with a liberal arts background (Political Science and History).
- I live with my family (pictured above) in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
- In my free time, I try to balance my indoor Octocat tendencies and interests (playing/listening to music, reading, video games, and photography) with being active and in trying to stay in shape (hockey, tennis, cycling, and keeping up with Zoey and Phoebe).
- I come to GitHub with six years of management experience, most recently at Wirecutter where I was a engineering manager and eventually a director responsible for their user-facing engineering teams.

## My Values
Values matter! Our values determine how we show up every day at work. Here are a few of mine:

| **Value**                               | **What does it mean to me?**                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Taking care of ourselves and each other | We all do better work in the long run if we maintain a healthy personal life/work balance and look out for each other.                                                         |
| Positivity                              | Approach projects and interactions assuming positive intent. This doesnâ€™t mean sugarcoating difficult conversations or news, withholding constructive feedback, or dishonesty. |
| Collaboration                           | We succeed and fail as a team, not as individuals.                                                                                                                             |
| Honesty                                 | Until mind reading is a thing, detailed, thoughtful, proactive, and honest communication is extremely important, especially in a remote work culture.                          |
| Respect                                 | No outcome justifies treating others with disrespect. If you mess up, make it right.                                                                                           |
| Growth mindset                          | Everyone can grow and improve given the right context, challenges, frame of mind, and feedback.                                                                                |
| Making an impact                        | Letâ€™s build the right thing, in the right way, with the right amount of investment.                                                                                            |
