# Manager README
This is meant to be a getting started guide to working with me for my direct reports and the engineers in the Projects org. I hope that it will be a living document and continue to change and evolve over time as I do the same üòÑ

## About me üë®‚Äçüë¶
You can call me Eric or EJ; either works! "EJ" became a thing in a previous gig when I worked closely with another Erik, and it's remained helpful to disambiguate among the various Eri(c)(k)s around GitHub.

- I am a self-taught engineer with a liberal arts background (Political Science and History).
- I live with my family ‚Äî wife Erica and kids Zoey (8), Phoebe (5), and Everett (1) ‚Äî in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
- I am an outgoing introvert; I have a large and varied group of friends and can be very social, but being around people (even on Zoom) is also very draining for me. I recharge by spending time by myself.
- In my free time, I try to balance my indoor Octocat tendencies and interests (playing/listening to music, reading, video games, and photography) with being active and in trying to stay in shape (hockey, tennis, cycling, and keeping up with Zoey, Phoebe, and Everett).
- I arrived at GitHub with six years of management experience, most recently at Wirecutter where I was a engineering manager and eventually a director responsible for their user-facing engineering teams.

## My values ‚ù§Ô∏è
Values matter! Our values determine how we show up every day at work. Here are some of mine:

| **Value**                               | **What does it mean to me?**                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Taking care of ourselves and each other | We all do better work in the long run if we maintain a healthy personal life/work balance and look out for each other.                                                         |
| Positivity                              | Approach projects and interactions assuming positive intent. This doesn‚Äôt mean sugarcoating difficult conversations or news, withholding constructive feedback, or dishonesty. |
| Collaboration                           | We succeed and fail as a team.                                                                                                                             |
| Diversity                               | We will build better software and reach more customers if our team is more broadly representative of the wider world. Examples include but aren't limited to training (CS vs non-traditional), experience level (SE 1 to Staff/Principal), skillset (backend, frontend, full-stack), ethnicity, gender, age, etc.).                          |
| Honest communication                    | In a remote-first culture, detailed, thoughtful, proactive, and honest communication is required to do our jobs well.                          |
| Respect                                 | No outcome justifies treating others with disrespect. If you mess up, make it right.                                                                                           |
| Growth mindset                          | Everyone can grow and improve given the right context, challenges, frame of mind, and feedback. Team processes should also evolve and change over time as we learn and grow together.                                                                                |
| Making an impact                        | Let‚Äôs build the right thing, in the right way, with the right amount of investment.                                                                                            |

## Some of my areas of growth
We are all works in progress ‚Äî including me! Here are a few of of things that I'm thinking about as I settle into my new role as a director at GitHub.

### Over-explaining
I am working on using less words to say more.

### Continuing to tweak the balance between acting quickly and waiting
During my time as a director at GitHub, I've gotten a lot more comfortable making decisions and moving quickly. Sometimes (maybe even often) this is the right approach, especially given how frequently things at GitHub change. However, sometimes it is better as a leader to wait a bit, observe, gather feedback, and _then_ act. I'm working on continuing to refine my approach.

## Some of my strengths üí™

### I take time to understand a situation before acting
This is the flipside of the area of growth I described above ‚Äî I generally won‚Äôt rush into action based on one conversation. I‚Äôll gather additional context and information (likely from multiple sources) as time allows to ensure that I truly understand what‚Äôs going on.

### I have a growth mindset and respond well to feedback
I _really_ appreciate it when people disagree with me and I especially appreciate it when people share constructive feedback with me. Constructive feedback is a gift!

### I am honest and I trust by default
I don‚Äôt play games, I don‚Äôt try to manipulate situations or people, and I won‚Äôt lie to you. You can also count on me to give you feedback when I see areas where you can improve based on my own observations and signal I've gathered from the team.

### I care about you as a human being
I got into management because I love coaching and helping people get the most out of their jobs and their careers, not to go on a power trip. To get the most out of our time together, I ask you to be honest with me about what you want and need from me. I will, in turn, be honest about what I want and need from you.

## Your job as an engineer
Your job as an engineer is pretty straightforward but challenging (and hopefully incredibly rewarding):

- Ship code that moves our business forward, balancing trade-offs between speed, quality, and features (EPD leadership can help with that).
- Support your teammates in their career journey with mentorship, pairing, code review, etc.
- Engage actively and continuously with the team, be it on Slack, in GitHub, or team meetings on video.

## Your job as a manager
- Partner with Product to own your team's roadmap and success, using whatever process or structure works best for the team
- Communicate risks and concerns proactively, ideally having thought about potentially solutions and a preferred path forward
- Support your team in their career growth, giving them positive and constructive feedback to help them achieve their goals and do their best work for GitHub
- Partner with me and other managers to drive initiatives across the team

## My job as a director üíº
- Build and maintain a team and organizational culture that allows us to attract, retain, and support top-class talent (that‚Äôs you!) who do amazing things for our custmers and GitHub.
  - This means setting and holding a high bar for all of you technically, in what we ship to customers, and in the culture within our teams.
- Set context and provide high level direction for the engineering teams working on Projects.
- Give feedback and provide coaching to help managers grow in their careers and achieve their goals.
- Work closing with Product and Design leads to ensure that we are working on the most important things.
- Set teams up for success to ship with momentum and quality.

## My expectations for you as a manager or engineer
- Be generous with your unique gifts ‚Äî teams are strongest when people contribute the work of the team without ego or comparison to the contributions of others
- Communicate and document frequently in whatever medium is most comfortable for you (e.g. Slack, GitHub, etc.).
- Hold yourself, your teammates, and me accountable to being the best team possible. (Credit to [Chiedo John](https://github.com/chiedo/leadership/blob/main/README.md) for this one)

### How I approach my job
I am not an authoritarian boss; I want to make sure you have the skills, space, and context to do your job in the best possible way and achieve your career goals. Your time at GitHub and in this group is one stop in your career path, and I want to make sure that you get the most out of our time working together.

I default to high autonomy; my preferred management mode is to trust you to handle your day-to-day work without direction from me. We hired you because you are smart and capable. I trust you to know your own limits and ask for support when needed. My goal is to offer clear context and feedback while giving you the autonomy to lead in your area. I‚Äôll step in more directly when needed, and I‚Äôll adapt as we learn what works best together.

## My working hours ‚è∞
- I try to keep strict hours of availability for meetings by blocking out time on my calendar. I encourage you to do the same!
- One of the things I like about remote work is the flexibility it gives me to step away for things like an event at my kids' school, to go for a walk, or even to take a short nap to recharge. The flip side of that for me is that I will often check Slack outside of core working hours. I will generally schedule messages for you if I'm working outside of those hours.
- I view it as part of my job to be available when you need me. If you want to reach me outside of work hours, please call, text, email, Slack, etc. at any time. I mean it.

## Communication üóØÔ∏è
As a child of AIM (screen name: guitarer1c2 üñ•Ô∏è), I love chatting on Slack! DMs are always open and encouraged. I believe that it is also important that we talk regularly face-to-face (okay, over video chat) as well. At minimum, I do weekly synchronous 1:1s with my direct reports. I also do skip-levels with all engineers in the org every quarter. You can also schedule a skip with me any time you'd like ‚Äî just grab time on my calendar; you don't need to ask for permission.

**The bottom line:** if you want to talk, we‚Äôll talk! My üìÜ is public ‚Äî you can and should schedule time with me whenever you want/need to.

## A final note on feedback ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I mentioned this above, but I'll say it again: I love feedback! Feedback is critical to your success at GitHub ‚Äî and mine as well. You would be doing me a huge favor if you give me constructive feedback to help me do my job better üôá

Let's build something amazing together! ‚ú®
