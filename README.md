# Manager README
This is meant to be a getting started guide to working with me. It captures things I've learned about myself as well as feedback from other people over the years. My hope is that it will be a living document and continue to change and evolve over time as I do the same üòÑ

## About me üë®‚Äçüë¶
First off, you can call me Eric or EJ (to avoid a Planning & Tracking name collision w/ [@aricwalker](https://github.com/aricwalker).

- I am a self-taught engineer and management nerd with a liberal arts background (Political Science and History).
- I live with my family ‚Äî wife Erica and daughters Zoey (5) and Phoebe (2) ‚Äî in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
- In my free time, I try to balance my indoor Octocat tendencies and interests (playing/listening to music, reading, video games, and photography) with being active and in trying to stay in shape (hockey, tennis, cycling, and keeping up with Zoey and Phoebe).
- I come to GitHub with six years of management experience, most recently at Wirecutter where I was a engineering manager and eventually a director responsible for their user-facing engineering teams.

## My values ‚ù§Ô∏è
Values matter! Our values determine how we show up every day at work. Here are some of mine:

| **Value**                               | **What does it mean to me?**                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Taking care of ourselves and each other | We all do better work in the long run if we maintain a healthy personal life/work balance and look out for each other.                                                         |
| Positivity                              | Approach projects and interactions assuming positive intent. This doesn‚Äôt mean sugarcoating difficult conversations or news, withholding constructive feedback, or dishonesty. |
| Collaboration                           | We succeed and fail as a team, not as individuals.                                                                                                                             |
| Diversity                                 | We will build better software and reach more customers if our team is more broadly representative of the wider world. Examples include but aren't limited to training (CS vs non-traditional, experience level, skillset, ethnicity, gender, etc.).                          |
| Honest communication                                 | In a remote-first culture, detailed, thoughtful, proactive, and honest communication is required to do our jobs well.                          |
| Respect                                 | No outcome justifies treating others with disrespect. If you mess up, make it right.                                                                                           |
| Growth mindset                          | Everyone can grow and improve given the right context, challenges, frame of mind, and feedback. Team processes should also evolve and change over time as we learn and grow together.                                                                                |
| Making an impact                        | Let‚Äôs build the right thing, in the right way, with the right amount of investment.                                                                                            |
## Some of my areas of growth ‚è´
We are all works in progress ‚Äî including me! Here are a few of of things that I'm thinking about as I settle into my role here.

### I'm new here
I realize that it‚Äôs a risk to join or new team or change managers, and, as a new Hubber (I joined GitHub in June ‚Äò22), I don‚Äôt have the context and organizational insight that other managers do. I‚Äôm making it one of my main priorities to meet people throughout GitHub and learn as much as I can as quickly as I can.

### Over-explaining
I like words. Sometimes, I use too many of them. I am working on using less to say more.

### Bias towards listening/learning before acting
By default, I generally listen and learn first before speaking or acting. After working with a leadership coach for the past two years (his name is Hector, and I will probably talk about him every so often), I've realized that I need to (kindly and humbly) speak up sooner rather than later with confidence and curiosity.

### I am most comfortable in 1:1 conversations
I find it incredibly awkward to speak to groups of people on Zoom üò¨ This means that sometimes I miss or shy away from opportunities to have larger conversations or send messages to a larger group. I am consistently pushing myself to grow in choosing the right venues for communication, but I could use your help and feedback along the way.

## Some of my strengths üí™

### I take time to understand a situation before acting
This is the flipside of the area of growth I described above ‚Äî I generally won‚Äôt rush into action based on one conversation. I‚Äôll gather additional context and information (likely from multiple sources) as time allows to ensure that I truly understand what‚Äôs going on.

### I have a growth mindset and respond well to feedback
One of the reasons I show up every day to work is because I want to learn and grow. I appreciate it when people disagree with me and/or share constructive feedback, and I treat those situations as opportunities to learn.

### I am honest and I trust by default
I don‚Äôt play games, I don‚Äôt try to manipulate situations or people, and I won‚Äôt lie to you. There may be certain topics that I can‚Äôt talk about, but, if you ask me a question, I‚Äôll tell you that. I won‚Äôt lie. You can also count on me to give you feedback when I see areas where you can improve.

Further, I am not closely scrutinizing you on a day-to-day basis to monitor you (e.g. how many hours you are working, Slack availability, etc.). I trust you to the do the job we‚Äôve hired you to do and be accountable to the team.

### I care about you as a human being
I got into management because I love coaching and helping people get the most out of their jobs and their careers, not to go on a power trip. To get the most out of our time together, I ask you to be honest with me about what you want and need from me. I will, in turn, be honest about what I want and need from you.


## Working hours ‚è∞

- I try to keep strict hours of availability for meetings by blocking out time on my calendar. I encourage you to do the same!
- I will almost never contact you off-hours, but in the rare chance I do, take it as a note for later unless it's an emergency (e.g. the site is down).
- All that said, I view it as part of my job to be available when you need me. If you want to reach me outside of work hours, please call, text, email, Slack, etc. at any time. I mean it.

## Your job ‚å®Ô∏è
I look at your job as an engineer as being pretty straightforward but challenging (and hopefully incredibly rewarding):

- Ship code that moves our business forward, balancing trade-offs between speed, quality, and features (I can help with that).
- Support your teammates in their career journey with mentorship, pairing, code review, etc.
- Engage actively and continuously with the team, be it on Slack, in GitHub, or team meetings on video.

### My expectations for you

- Be generous with your unique gifts ‚Äî teams are strongest when people contribute the work of the team without ego or comparison to the contributions of others
- Communicate and document frequently in whatever medium is most comfortable for you (e.g. Slack, GitHub, etc.).
- Hold yourself, your teammates, and me accountable to being the best team possible. (Credit to [Chiedo John](https://github.com/chiedo/leadership/blob/main/README.md) for this one)

## My job üíº
My job as a manager is simple to describe (but maybe not always easy to execute üòÜ).

It is to:

- Build and maintain a team and organizational culture that allows us to attract, retain, and support top-class talent (that‚Äôs you!).
- Set context and provide high level direction for engineers (that‚Äôs also you!).
- Give feedback and provide coaching to help engineers grow in their careers and achieve their goals.
- Work with other managers, leadership, and engineers to plan and scope future work.
- Ensure that we are building the right thing in the right way in the right amount of time.

### How I approach my job
I am not an authoritarian boss; I want to make sure you have the skills, space, and context to do [your job](#your-job-%EF%B8%8F) in the best possible way and achieve your career goals. Your time at GitHub and on this team is one stop in your career path. I want to make sure that you get the most out of your time here.

I default to high autonomy; my preferred management mode is to trust you to handle your day-to-day work without much guidance or direction from me. We hired you because you are smart and capable. I trust you to know your own limits and ask for support when needed. I may provide suggestions and raise concerns, but I will generally not force a solution.

Everyone is different, and I realize some people need more guidance than others. If you need more direction from me, please let me know as soon as possible.
I will get better at finding the right balance as we get to know each other better!

## Communication üóØÔ∏è

As a child of AIM (screen name: guitarer1c2 üñ•Ô∏è), I love chatting on Slack. That said, it‚Äôs also important that we talk regularly face-to-face (okay, over video chat) as well. At minimum, we'll have a weekly synchronous 1:1 (more on that below) via video or phone. If you prefer synchronous video/audio communication, please let me know, and I will use that as our default.

**The bottom line:** if you want to talk, we‚Äôll talk! My üìÜ is public ‚Äî you can and should schedule time with me whenever you want/need to.

### 1:1s üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë
As mentioned above, you and I will have a weekly 30-minute 1:1. This time is not meant to be a project status report (there are lots of other opportunities to do that).

Instead, we should talk about things like:

- How you are feeling in general about your job
- Successes
- Fears and concerns
- Short- and long-term goals
- Feedback (either for you or for me)
- Advice/coaching

## A final note on feedback ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I love feedback! Feedback is critical to your success at GitHub ‚Äî and mine as well. You would be doing me a huge favor if you give me constructive feedback to help me do my job better üôá

Let's build something amazing together! ‚ú®
